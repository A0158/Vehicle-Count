1.I decided to inculcate Background Subtractor technique in my model.It is used to subtract background from the image by extracting 
the moving foreground from the static background.I used recursive for the same.In this method  background model update recursively by exponential weighting from the past.
I chose KNN and MOG.
2.I chose KNN model during daytime because it is non-parametric and is computationally efficient.I chose MOG algorithm during night
time because it counts vehicle on the basis of heuristics.MOG maintains density function per pixel and works well during night.
3.The other models I could have chosen are CNT,GMG,GSOC,SBP,FGD.
4.My current model is better because MOG provides adaptability to various night scenes as each pixel corresponding to background colors is based on variance of each gaussians. 
.It is sensitive to illumination.
Thats why I used KNN during day time because nearest neighbours have high contribution towards background estimation.During daytime KNN shows least noise and is 
computationally efficient as compared to other models I have tested.
